## Notes

### Production Considerations
1. **File Storage**: Current implementation uses local disk storage
   - For production, consider cloud storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage)
   - Update upload middleware to use cloud SDK

2. **File Size**: Current limit is 10MB
   - Adjust based on expected file sizes
   - Consider compression for large files

3. **Security**:
   - Add authentication middleware to all routes (currently open)
   - Validate user permissions (only coordinators should manage)
   - Add rate limiting for file uploads

4. **Performance**:
   - Add pagination for company list
   - Lazy load eligible students (don't fetch in list view)
   - Add caching for frequently accessed companies

5. **Monitoring**:
   - Log file upload operations
   - Track failed Excel parsing attempts
   - Monitor disk usage for uploads directory

## Success Metrics

✅ **Backend**
- All 7 API endpoints created and working
- File upload middleware configured
- Excel parsing with flexible column matching
- Proper error handling and validation
- MongoDB schema optimized with indexes

✅ **Frontend**
- Complete CRUD integration
- File upload with FormData
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Loading and empty states
- Excel template download

✅ **Integration**
- Frontend successfully calls all backend APIs
- File uploads work end-to-end
- Excel parsing produces correct data
- Error messages propagate to UI
- No TypeScript/ESLint errors

## Next Steps

1. **Test the integration**:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   npm run dev

   # Frontend
   cd ..
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to**: http://localhost:3000/coordinator/companies

3. **Test operations**:
   - Download template
   - Fill template with sample data
   - Upload company with Excel file
   - View company in list
   - Edit company
   - Delete company

4. **Verify MongoDB**:
   ```bash
   mongosh
   use easyprep
   db.companies.find().pretty()
   ```

5. **Check uploads directory**:
   ```bash
   ls -la backend/uploads/
   ```
